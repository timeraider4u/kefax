High priority:

	- Batch-mode and trim-preprocess have to be XOR!!!
		trim-preprocess is deleting code directives from a preprocessing
		unit and, therefore, when this preprocessing file is going to be
		re-used / loaded from model later on by another discoverer
		invocation it will be missing this code lines and yield to 
		errors during parser validation
	
	# error during validation of unit='[ERROR:no viable alternative at input 'include_next'
	#(file:/usr/include/limits.h line : 123)]'

Low priority:
	- Fixes for failing JUnit tests in at.jku.weiner.c.preprocess.tests
