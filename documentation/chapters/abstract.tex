This project aims to use a C code parser 
to walk through the produced abstract syntax tree (AST) 
to provide an importer to the {\it ECCO}
({\it Extraction and Composition for Clone-and-Own})
tool. The goal is
to offer case studies for the feature model exploration 
implementations in {\it ECCO}.
Various approaches have been explored and finally
Eclipse MoDisco in combination with the Xtext
plug-in have been chosen to reverse-engineer C programs
and import them into the EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework).
