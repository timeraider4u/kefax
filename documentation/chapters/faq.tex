Question & Answer \\ \hline
Can I use another (probably newer) version of 
{\it org.xtext.antlr.generator} or
{\it Xtext}? 
& No! There have been several changes made to these
software products which are the moment not available
in upstream. There are also some bugs which prevent
me from efficiently getting these changes d'accord
with the master branches, e.g. see bug reports at
\cite{Xtext_bug_1} \cite{Xtext_bug_2} which
themselves required that a bug/feature request
in the {\it EMF genmodel}
generator\cite{EMF_bug_1} needs to be
fixed first.
Anyway, even if I could start a pull request for
the changes made so far, it would be questionable
if they get integrated into the git head at anytime.

Can I use another (probably newer) version of 
{\it Eclipse MoDisco} or {\it NeoEMF}?
& Yes, you might give them a try. Please
report if newer versions work / do not work for you.
You may use the official update site for 
{\it NeoEMF} because the issues reported in 
\cite{NeoEMF_issue_7}
and \cite{NeoEMF_issue_8} have already been merged
into the master branch and made their way into the 
{\it NeoEMF} official update site.
