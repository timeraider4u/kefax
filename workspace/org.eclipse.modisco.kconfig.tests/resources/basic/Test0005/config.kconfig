config OPROFILE
	tristate "OProfile system profiling"
	help
	  OProfile is a profiling system capable of profiling the
	  whole system, include the kernel, kernel modules, libraries,
	  and applications.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HAVE_OPROFILE
	bool

config KPROBES
	bool "Kprobes"
	help
	  Kprobes allows you to trap at almost any kernel address and
	  execute a callback function.  register_kprobe() establishes
	  a probepoint and specifies the callback.  Kprobes is useful
	  for kernel debugging, non-intrusive instrumentation and testing.
	  If in doubt, say "N".

config X86_CHECK_BIOS_CORRUPTION
	bool "Check for low memory corruption"
	---help---
	  Periodically check for memory corruption in low memory, which
	  is suspected to be caused by BIOS.  Even when enabled in the
	  configuration, it is disabled at runtime.  Enable it by
	  setting "memory_corruption_check=1" on the kernel command
	  line.  By default it scans the low 64k of memory every 60
	  seconds; see the memory_corruption_check_size and
	  memory_corruption_check_period parameters in
	  Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt to adjust this.

	  When enabled with the default parameters, this option has
	  almost no overhead, as it reserves a relatively small amount
	  of memory and scans it infrequently.  It both detects corruption
	  and prevents it from affecting the running system.

	  It is, however, intended as a diagnostic tool; if repeatable
	  BIOS-originated corruption always affects the same memory,
	  you can use memmap= to prevent the kernel from using that
	  memory.
