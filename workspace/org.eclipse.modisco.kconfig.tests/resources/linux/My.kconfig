		You should set this to the number of CPUs in your system, but
		keep in mind that a kernel compiled for, e.g., 2 CPUs will boot but
		only use 2 CPUs on a >2 CPU system.
		Setting this to a value larger
		than 64 will cause the use of a CPU mask array, causing a small
		performance hit.

		Say Y here to experiment with turning CPUs off and on.
		can be controlled through /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#.
		Say N if you want to disable CPU hotplug.
